					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that there are certain elements in the interface that are
								more appealing to the human eye. Things like closure, symmetry, and similarity actually
								play a role in guiding users to a certain part of the interface. It is really important to
								keep in mind how are minds are attracted to certain things when we design. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was the closure principle. I really thought that
								it was really cool seeing how gaps can be more appealing because our brains fill in 
								those gaps. For example, I really liked the USA network logo and how the S was the gap. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "It has its own “weird” way of perceiving shape and form, grouping information, fill in the gaps to draw the big picture." </p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Feedback</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a five, please briefly explain why.</p>
							<p> 9, because of how informational it was. I learned so much regarding different strategies that UI designers use to appeal to users.</p>
