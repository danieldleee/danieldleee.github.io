                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> There are so many beautiful and amazing UI's that were presented in this article. In terms of UI design, I learned so much about the endless possibilities and ideas
                                that can be produced like the ones shown in the article. I learned that there is so much more to just UI and how you can make it so much more interactive through the design of
                                the different components on the product.
                            </p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favorite part of the article was the Travel Map which was by Never Stop. I loved the type bar and its features. I loved how when you click on the 
                                bar, it shows a really neat animation as if it got cracked open for the user to type in. I also love the feature when you type in the destination and the choices
                                narrow down for you with a special animation. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> As I said in the previous question, I loved the UI of the Travel Map because of its animations and how it comes out as you interact with it more.
                                I also loved the "Add to Cart" interface because of how interactive it was. Like the Travel Map, as you customize your product, it shows more animations that are really
                                attractive to the eye. I also loved the "Dark" interface and how it uses its colors and its features to make the user see what the image looks like if you
                                drag it side by side. All of these UI's are so beautiful and they make you want to interact with the page more because of how visually appealing they all are.</p>
