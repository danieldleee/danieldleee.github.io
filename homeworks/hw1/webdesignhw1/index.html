                <li> I learned that for design it is important to understand the aspects of an app that standout in comparison to others. Understanding why certain parts in the UI are highlighted will be crucial for me as a designer.  </li>
                <li> My favorite part of this article was analyzing the design of AirBnB. I thought that it was really cool seeing how they used the wording in the search bar to appeal for the users to explore the app more.</li>
                <li>"You develop your design eye by thinking as if you were the designer of a product. Open an app you use often and resist the urge to start scrolling through content. Instead, I want you to actively focus on the screen in front of you."</li>
                <li>I would give this a 7 because I felt that it gave me a fresh perspective towards web design!</li>
