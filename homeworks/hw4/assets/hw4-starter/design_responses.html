						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I think for me this whole article was very new to me! I did not know that there are regulations
								regarding color accessibility in product design. I think it was really important for me to read this 
								article because it informed me about the importance of a product being accessible to all people, including those with 
								impairments. It made me reflect on how websites are designed in order to be accessible to everyone. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was the color contrast standard. I thought that it was really interesting
								that there has to be a guideline behind the contrast of the font and the background color. I thought that it makes
								sense that there should be for those with color visual impairments. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Also, not creating accessible products is just rude, so donâ€™t be rude."" </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
