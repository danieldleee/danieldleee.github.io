						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I think from this article, I really saw how important white space is in the general interface of a website. Being able to use padding 
								correctly is powerful because it helps direct user attention towards the content. There needs to be some white space in between different
								copy and images because it helps make each item and individual thing rather than a group. White space is crucial in making the general
								interface clean and organized for the user. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was end where they disprove a lot of common opinions regarding having white space in a product. A lot of times
								it is easy to assume that having white space is essentially a waste of space. However, as shown in the examples in the article, white space is powerful in 
								making the content organized and more easily navigable for users. It is also easy to assume that white space can make it harder for users to focus on content,
								however it is moreso the opposite in regards to helping the users focus on an individual part of the interface. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Think of white space as a breath of fresh air. Just as humans need air to breathe, designs need white space to breathe." </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
