					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Using the favorite website you chose in homework 1, create a wireframe for one page of it using pen/paper, PowerPoint, or any your tool of choice. (use the 'img' tag!) Make sure to let us know what the name of your website is (Use the 'p' tag!)</p>
							<img src = assets/imgs/IMG_1901.JPG
								style="max-width: 25%;" /> 
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Try to improve the website you've chosen, and create a redesigned wireframe of one page for the same website using the principles of visual hierarchy that you learned from the article.</p>
							<img src = assets/imgs/IMG_1902.JPG
								style="max-width: 25%;" /> 
						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Responses</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is the goal of the website? Who is it intended for? How does the design accomplish this? Write 2-3 sentences answering these questions. (Use the 'p' tag again!)</p>
							<p> The goal of this website is to let users experience interacting with AI. It helps all users solve problems, reach certain goals, etc. It can help businesses as well as it uses lots of data to solve different problems. The design accomplishes this by guiding the user to use the search bar to ask questions.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Write 2-3 sentences about what problems your redesign addressed, and how it solved them.</p>
							<p> One big thing that I solve in my redesign is making deleting one conversation at a time much more easier to see. 
								I think by floating the mouse directly over the conversation, it should make it very clear that you can access it or delete the conversation. 
								The previous UI somewhat pushes those options on the side of the button when the mouse floats above it. 
								Also, another issue that I believe my redesign fixes is the appeal of the ChatGPT Plus. Instead, of putting it on the side of site where people can not see it as well, I put it on the bottom so people can be more attracted to try it out.
								Also, I put one of the examples in the type bar, so that it can show people where to ask their questions more directly.</p>
						</li>
						<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Make sure to include the wireframe images in the website and don't just put it in your assets folder!</p></li>
						<p>Your wireframes should look something like this:</p>
				<img class="img-scaled" src="assets/imgs/wireframe.png"/>
